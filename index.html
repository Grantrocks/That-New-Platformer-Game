        <h3>Description</h3>
<p>That New Platformer Game is about just jumping and walking around and collecting coins. I have many ideas for this game and a multiplayer option is one of them for the future. I really hope you enjoy playing! Also do not clear your cookies as you WILL lose all of your game data.</p>
